            Hey there! I'm Humza, a passionate software developer on a journey
            of constant growth. It all began three years ago when I embarked on
            my web development adventure through The Odin Project. What started
            as curiosity quickly evolved into a full-fledged passion, shaping
            the path that led me to where I am today. My thirst for knowledge
            drives me to explore emerging technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey has led me to the vibrant realm of software development.
            Currently, I'm a software developer at Project Human City,
            channeling my skills into crafting solutions that combine
            cutting-edge technology with meaningful impact. From responsive
            single-page wonders to intricate full stack marvels, I thrive on
            translating ideas into tangible digital experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Recently graduated in Computer Engineering from York University, I'm driven by a hunger for progress. Beyond the lines of code, I'm immersing myself in the dynamic realms of cloud computing and AI, exploring the thrilling intersection of innovation and mastery.

            One of my proudest achievements is 'CrimeVue.' This web app is more
            than codeâ€”it's an impactful solution that plots crime data on a map,
            empowering users with insights that drive safer communities.
